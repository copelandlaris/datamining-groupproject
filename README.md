Group Project for Data Mining Analyzing US water quality


Data Mining Group Project
Our project analyzes data from EPA water monitoring sites for contaminantents, primarily focusing on (but not limited to) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water sources. PFAS are synthetic chemicals widely used in industrial and consumer products that have been linked to environmental and health risks. Out team will apply data mining techniques to identify patterns and trends across contaimination levels between different water sources and geographic locations.

Research Questions
Our initial questions of interst:

Can we predict PFAS levels for future years?
What states have the worst water quality/what are high risk areas?
How do contamination patterns vary by region
How do contamination levels vary by water source type? Groundwater etc.
Which contaminant appears the most over time?
How does contamination vary over time?
How does contamination correlate with poverty?
How does contamination correlate with population/density?
Do certain contaminants appear together?
Does this point us to any treatment plans for the future?
